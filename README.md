#### A Rust Based Task Scheduler for Out of Core Scientific Computing

Can we create something like Dask but for scientific computing in Rust? Out of core scientific computing is vital for a large variety of numerical computations, and useful for deployment to a diverse set of hardware. As we are developing Rust based linear algebra tools, and derived parallel software, it would be useful to explore whether a Rust based task scheduler would give us access to high-performance out of core computing with our codes.
